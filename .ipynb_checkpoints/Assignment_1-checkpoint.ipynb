    "\n",

    "In this assignment, you're going to write your own methods to fit a linear model using either an OLS or LAD cost function. At the end you will compare them to the implementation to the implementation of `statsmodels`.  \n",

    "In this assignment, we have provided hints and partial solutions. Your job is to fill in the missing components.\n",

    "## Data set \n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, we will examine some data representing possums in Australia and New Guinea. The data frame contains 46 observations on the following 6 variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "* sex: Sex, either m (male) or f (female).\n",
    "* age: Age in years.\n",
    "* headL: Head length, in mm.\n",

    "1.  Restart your kernel by clicking 'Kernel' > 'Restart & Run All'.\n",

    "2.  Fix any errors which result from this.\n",
